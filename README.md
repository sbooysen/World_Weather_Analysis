## PlanMyTrip API Project
### By: Stacey Booysen

In this project, we brought together various attributes in order to create an output for customers that would display latitude, longitude, weather, and hotels nearby. By adding these factors for customers to search, it helps them determine not only the best hotel at their location, but also whether or not the weather will be ideal when they go on their trip.

There were a randomized set of locations chosen for the test run and several factors were taken into consideration when figuring out what to display. We plotted a route between four cities in Spain and showed the weather conditions to aide in any travel decision-making. 

Overall, the APIs pulled in tons of useful information, both from google maps and from the open weather app. Combining these allowed us to give a more comprehensive look at any location that a customer might consider visiting.
